Now I know what you're thinking++?++ Oh no++?++ 's in a cage++?++ How did this happen++?++ Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody++?++ It's a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero++?++ See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times++?++ Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things++?++++?++++?++ didn't find any++?++ That's when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage++?++++?++++?++ where I met you++?++ How much longer do you think we'll be here++?++ Surtur++?++ Son of a bitch++?++++?++++?++you're still alive++?++ I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago++?++ You know, it's funny you should mention that because I've been having these terrible dreams of late++?++ Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them++?++ Hang on++?++   Hang on++?++ I'll be back around shortly++?++ I really feel like we were connecting there++?++ Okay, so, Ragnarok++?++ Tell me about that++?++ Walk me through it++?++ Oh, hang on++?++ Give it a second++?++ I swear I'm not even moving, it's just doing this on its own++?++ I'm really sorry++?++ Okay, let me get this straight++?++ You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house-- The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard++?++ Okay, so where is it++?++ This crown++?++ Oh, that's a crown++?++ I thought it was a big eyebrow++?++ Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head++?++ That's intense++?++ To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle++?++ But it looks like I'm going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard's vault++?++ Because that's what heroes do++?++ Wait, sorry++?++ I didn't time that right++?++ And, now++?++ I make grave mistakes all the time++?++ Everything seems to work out++?++ Heimdall++?++ I know it's been a while, but I could use a fast exit++?++ ++?++++?++++?++Heimdall++?++ Heimdall, come on++?++ Stay++?++ I'm running short on-- -options++?++ Heimdall++?++ Who are you++?++ Right++?++   Where's Heimdall++?++ Traitor++?++ Sure++?++ What the hell is that++?++ Father++?++ It's an interesting play++?++    What's it called++?++ Indeed they should++?++ I like that statue++?++ A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though++?++ A little less weasely++?++ Less greasy maybe++?++ You know what this is++?++ Do me a favor++?++ Lock this in a vault so it doesn't turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet++?++ Nope++?++ I've been having this reocurring dream lately++?++ Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins++?++++?++++?++ Possibly++?++++?++++?++ but then I decide to go out there and investigate++?++ And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos++?++ Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise, all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms, are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes++?++ Of course, the freedom to be massacred++?++ Watching theatre++?++ You really going to make me do it++?++ You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand++?++ Not even your face++?++ Then I'll see you on the other side++?++++?++++?++brother++?++ Where's Odin++?++ Where's father++?++    Did you kill him++?++ Right here on the sidewalk++?++ Or right there, where the building that's being demolished++?++ Great planning++?++ Then why do you dress like one++?++ I can't believe you're alive++?++ I saw you die++?++ I mourned you, I cried for you++?++ Sure++?++ Start figuring out where he is++?++ She didn't dump me, you know++?++       I dumped her++?++ It was a mutual dumping++?++ What's this, what are you doing++?++++?++ Loki++?++ So earth has wizards now++?++ Alright wizard, who are you++?++   Why should I care++?++ I don't drink tea++?++ Not tea++?++ He's a worthy inclusion++?++ We're looking for my father++?++ Promptly++?++ If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me++?++ No, I don't have a phone, but you could have sent an electronic letter++?++ It's called an email++?++ No++?++ What for++?++ (beat) Anyway, my father is no longer in exile++?++ So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home++?++ Will you stop doing that++?++ Let me explain something, my hair is not to be meddled wi-++?++ We could have just walked++?++ All right++?++ Yes++?++ Sorry I suppose I'll need my brother back++?++ Yeah of course++?++ Thank you very much for your help++?++ Loki++?++ Father++?++ Father, it's us++?++ I know++?++    We've come to take you home++?++ Loki, lift your magic++?++ I know that we failed you, but we can make this right++?++ No, I've stopped Ragnarok++?++    I put an end to Surtur++?++ Father, who are you talking about++?++ ++?++++?++++?++what++?++ Whatever she is, we can stop her++?++ We can face her together++?++ This was your doing++?++ You must be Hela++?++   I'm ,

fought the Grandmaster's Champion++?++ What about you++?++ You're made of rocks++?++ Yes I am++?++ Fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place++?++ Odin, I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla++?++++?++++?++ Where the brave shall live forever++?++ Nor shall we mourn but rejoice- What would you like me to say++?++ You faked your own death, you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranded him on Earth++?++++?++++?++ to die, releasing the Goddess of Death++?++ Have I said enough, or do you do you want me to go further back than the past two days++?++ No++?++ I really wish I had my hammer++?++ Quite unique++?++ It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star++?++ And when I spun it really, really fast it gave me the ability to fly++?++ No, I didn't ride the hammer++?++ No++?++ I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the++?++++?++++?++ The ground++?++ It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly++?++ Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me++?++ That's a nice way of putting it++?++ See her, the one that put me in here++?++ Asgardian++?++ Hey++?++   Hey++?++ Do not zap me with that

elite force of women warriors++?++ It's about time++?++ Please, help me++?++     I need your help++?++ Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward because the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne++?++ By Odin's beard, you shall not cut my hair++?++++?++++?++ lest you feel the wrath of the might ++?++ Please++?++ Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair++?++ No++?++ Yes++?++ Hey++?++ We know

betray me++?++ Round and round in circles we go++?++ See, Loki, life is about, it's about growth++?++ It's about change++?++ But you seem to just wanna stay the same++?++ I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll always be the God of Mischief, but you could be more++?++ I'll just put this over here for you++?++ Anyway, I got places to be so good luck++?++ All right, I can figure this

me++?++ I understand why you're angry++?++ And you are my sister, and technically have a claim to the throne++?++ And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule++?++ But it can't be you++?++ You're just++?++++?++++?++the worst++?++ (standing up) You know, Father once told me that a wise king never seeks out war++?++ She's too strong++?++   Without my hammer I cannot-- It's too late++?++ She's already taken Asgard++?++ I'm not as strong as you++?++ You're late++?++ I think we should disband the Revengers++?++ I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning++?++ It did nothing++?++ It won't end there++?++ The longer Hela's on Asgard the more powerful she grows++?++ She'll hunt us down++?++ We need to stop her here and now++?++ Asgard's not a place, it's a people++?++ (then) This was never about stopping Ragnarok++?++++?++++?++it was about causing Ragnarok++?++ (to Loki:) Go to the vault++?++ Surtur's crown++?++ It's the only way++?++
